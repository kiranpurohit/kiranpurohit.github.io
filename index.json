However, they also come with an enormous model size and heavy computational cost. Filter pruning (FP) is one of the methods applied to CNNs for compression and acceleration. Various techniques have been recently proposed for filter pruning. We address the limitation of the existing state-of-the-art method and motivate our setup. We develop a novel method for filter selection using sparse approximation of filter weights. We propose an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based algorithm for filter pruning (called FP-OMP). We also propose FP-OMP Search, which address the problem of removal of uniform number of filters from all the layers of a network. FP-OMP Search performs a search over all the layers with a given batch size of filter removal. We evaluate both FP-OMP and FP-OMP Search on benchmark datasets using standard ResNet architectures. Experimental results indicate that FP-OMP Search consistently outperforms the baseline method (LRF) by nearly 0.5 − 3%. We demonstrate both empirically and visually, that FP-OMP Search prunes different number of filters from different layers. Further, timing profile experiments show that FP-OMP improves over the running time of LRF.","tags":null,"title":"Accurate and efficient channel pruning via orthogonal matching pursuit","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["cpp to java cheatsheet"],"content":"Some differences between c++ and java:\n  Java compiled code is platform independent whereas c++ compiled code is platform dependent\n  Java interpreter reports the run-time error that caused the execution to halt unlike in c/c++ programs which may simply crash\n  c/c++ do not have strict sizes for the fundamental datatypes(varies from machine to machine) whereas Java defines strict sizes for their datatypes\n  Java has additional positive and negative zeros, positive and neagtive infinites and \u0026ldquo;nan\u0026rdquo;(not a number values)\n  c/c++ has functions while Java has methods.In c/c++ functions can be defined outside a class Java doesnot allow methods to be defined outside a class.\n  Unlike c++ arrays, Java arrays are objects.\n  Unlike c++, strings are immutable in Java.\n  While in c++ classes \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;protected\u0026rdquo; are labels , in Java they are modifiers.

A variable is a storage location for a value. Linux has environment variables. It can store strings, numbers , etc. just like the variables in C, C++, python, or any other programming language. It even has a scope, just like the variables in other programming languages! Based on scopes Linux environments variables can be classified into 2 different categories:\n Local Variables Global Variable  Local Variables Local variables are set by typing \u0026lt;variable_name\u0026gt;= \u0026lt;variable_value\u0026gt; (i.e without the export command). Local variables can only be accessed by the terminal where it is declared and not by any program even if it is run from the terminal itself.\nGlobal Variables Global variables are set by typing export \u0026lt;variable_name\u0026gt;= \u0026lt;variable_value\u0026gt;. The export command ensures that the variable be exported to any child process forked from that terminal. In short, it ensure that the variable set is global.\nUnderstanding the Difference There is a simple way to understand the difference between local and global environmnent variables.\nOpen a terminal\nexport global_var=\u0026quot;This is a global variable\u0026quot; local_var = \u0026quot;This is a local variable\u0026quot; echo $global_var echo $local_var  Now open tmuxa tmux session. Inside the session, type:\necho $global_var echo $local_var  You would notice that the local variable inside the tmux session contains no value whereas the global variable outputs the value that it has been assigned. You can see all the variables defined using the command \u0026lsquo;env\u0026rsquo;. A variable is unset by typing unset \u0026lt;variable_name\u0026gt;\nSome Important Paths in Linux: In this journey of learning how to install packages locally in linux, we need to about two very important global environment variables:\n PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH  what is PATH? PATH is a list of colon separated directories in which the system looks for executable files. When we type a command the system looks for the executable binaries in each of these directories and executes them if found or else returns an error stating \u0026lsquo;command not found\u0026rsquo;. This lookup by the system occurs in a left-to-right fashion. That is,the system first looks for the executable in the left-most directory in the colon separated list and proceeds on to the next if not found. This sequence of lookup is necessary to understand because if you have two different executable files with the same name but at different locations(obviously!!), say /usr/local/bin/python and ./anaconda/bin/python , and you want to execute the ./anaconda/bin/python ,then you would have to put ./anaconda/bin(absolute location is preferred, this is a relative location) to the left of /usr/bin in the colon separated list of PATH.\nWhat is LD_LIBRARY_PATH? Similar to PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH stores the colon separated list of directories where the system should search for libraries first, before the standard set of directories. Just like PATH, the lookup in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH also occurs in a left-to-right manner.\nHands On!!! In this demo we will be installing GNU-aspell locally.\n Download the package from this link and extract it using tar -xf aspell-0.60.7.tar.gz command. Go inside the directory and type ./configure --help. This will list the options for changing the default setup locations among other things. Have a look at the options, especially the --prefix, --exec-prefix , --oldincludedir and --datadir options. We will be using these. Now run configure with the options containing the locations you desire. As an example let me share what I have done: ./configure --prefix='/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/' --exec-prefix='/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/' --oldincludedir='/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/include/' --datadir='/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/data/aspell/'. Here anuragroy is my username and local_install_dirs can be thought of as a substitute for the /usr/local directory. After the configuration is done type: {%highlight bash %} make; make clean ``` to install the package. What now remains is to set the required environment variables in the .bashrc file. I have added the following lines:  export PATH=\u0026quot;/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/bin:$PATH\u0026quot; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\u0026quot;/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\u0026quot; export C_INCLUDE_PATH=\u0026quot;/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\u0026quot; export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=\u0026quot;/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\u0026quot; export MANPATH=\u0026quot;/home/anuragroy/local_install_dirs/data/aspell/man:$MANPATH\u0026quot;  And now aspell is installed!!! 😄\nNote: Python packages relying on local libraries(for example libraries located in ~/local_install_dirs/lib), headers(for example libraries located in ~/local_install_dirs/include) will return a cannot find.. error.There is a way around though \u0026mdash;clone the repository of the package and modify the relevant variables accordingly(like library_dirs for libraries and include_dirs for headers).\n","date":1568301113,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568301113,"objectID":"e453c8584c65b85af95dfdde2cbe9e9d","permalink":"https://kiranpurohit.github.io/news/how_to_install_packages_locally_in_linux/","publishdate":"2019-09-12T20:41:53+05:30","relpermalink":"/news/how_to_install_packages_locally_in_linux/","section":"news","summary":"Some Prerequisites What is a variable?

The value then of an arbitrary action $a$, denoted $q_∗(a)$, is the expected reward given that a is selected:\n$q_∗(a) = E[R_t | A_t = a]$\nWe denote the estimated value of action $a$ at time $t$ as $Q_t(a) \\approx q_*(a)$ .\nActions whose $Q_t$ value is the highest at time $t$, are called, greedy actions.All the other actions at time $t$ are called non-greedy actions.Selecting a greedy action is said to be exploitation whereas selecting a non-greedy action is said to be evaluation.Exploitation is the right thing to do to maximize the expected on the one step, but exploration may produce greater total reward in the long run.\nAction Value Methods So now we know that the true value of an action is the mean reward when the action is chosen.There can be many ways of calcuate this, one way can be:\n$$Q_t(a) = \\frac{\\text{sum of rewards when a is taken prior to t}}{\\text{number of times a is taken prior to t}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} R_i \\cdot 1_{A_i = a}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} 1_{A_i = a}}$$\nwhere $1_predicate$ denotes the random variable that is $1$ if $predicate$ is true and $0$ if it is not. If the denominator is zero, then we instead de\u000cnote $Q_t(a)$ as some default value, such as $Q_1(a) = 0$ . As the denominator goes to in\u000cfnity, by the law of large numbers, $Q_t(a)$ converges to $q_*(a)$. We call this the *sample-average* method for estimating action values because each *estimate* is an average of the *sample* of relevant rewards.\nThe greedy actions selection method (a.k.a exploitation) can be represented as:\n$A_t = \\underset{x}{\\operatorname{argmax}}Q_t(a)$\nWhere $argmax_a$ denotes the value of $a$ at which the expressio that follows is maximized(with ties broken arbitrarily). A simple alternative to this purely greedy approach is a $\\varepsilon-greedy$ approach where with probability $\\varepsilon$ , select an action from the set of non-greedy actions unformly and randomly.\nIncremental Implementation We would now dive into the implementation of the above formulae to reinforcement learning problems. Lets concentrate on a single action $a$. Let $R_i$ denote the reward received after the $ith$ selection of this action.Let $Q_n$ denote the estimate of this action after it has been selected n-1 times. Then we can write:\n$$Q_n(a) = \\frac{R_1 + R_2 +\u0026hellip;+ R_{n-1}}{n-1}$$\nKeeping a record of all the rewards will be inefficient in terms of memory, so we would tweak the formula a little bit:\n $$ \\begin{align} Q_{n+1} \u0026 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{1}{n}\\bigl(R_n + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i\\bigr) \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{1}{n}\\bigl(R_n + (n-1)\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i\\bigr) \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{1}{n}\\bigl(R_n + (n-1)Q_n\\bigr) \\\\ \u0026 = \\frac{1}{n}\\bigl(R_n + nQ_n - Q_n\\bigr) \\\\ \u0026 = Q_n + \\frac{1}{n}[R_n - Q_n] \\end{align} $$  A Simple Bandit Algorithm  $$ \\begin{align} \u0026 \\text{Initialize, for a } = 1 \\text{ to k}: \\\\ \u0026 \\quad Q(a) \\leftarrow 0 \\\\ \u0026 \\quad N(a) \\leftarrow 0 \\\\ \u0026 \\text{Repeat Forever:} \\\\ \u0026 \\quad A \\leftarrow \\begin{cases} \\underset{a}{\\operatorname{argmax}}Q(a) \\text{ with probability 1-} \\varepsilon \\text{ (breaking ties randomly)} \\\\ \\text{ a random action with probability } \\varepsilon \\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ \u0026 R \\leftarrow bandit(a) \\\\ \u0026 N(A) \\leftarrow N(A) + 1 \\\\ \u0026 Q(A) \\leftarrow Q(A) + \\frac{1}{N(A)}[R - Q(A)] \\end{align} $$  The $\\frac{1}{N(A)}$ parameter (a.k.a StepSize) changes from time step to time step and can also be written as $\\alpha_{t}(a)$.\n$\\alpha_{t}(a)$ is any function that satisfies the following conditions :\n$\\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty}\\alpha_{t}(a) = \\infty \\text{ and } \\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha_{t}^2(a) \\lt \\infty $\nFor the time-being let us consider $\\alpha_t$ to be a constant (say $\\alpha \\epsilon (0,1]$ ). We can also write $Q_{n+1}$ in terms of $Q_1$:\n $$\\begin{align} Q_{n+1} \u0026 = Q_n + \\alpha [R_n - Q_n] \\\\ \u0026 = \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)Q_n \\\\ \u0026 = \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)[\\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)Q_{n-1}] \\\\ \u0026 = \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)[\\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)Q_{n-1}] \\\\ \u0026 = \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)\\alpha R_{n-1} + (1 - \\alpha)^2 Q_{n-1} \\\\ \u0026 = \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)\\alpha R_{n-1} + (1 - \\alpha)^2 \\alpha R_{n-2} + \\\\ \u0026 ... + (1 - \\alpha)^{n-1}\\alpha R_1 + (1 - \\alpha)^n Q_1 \\\\ \u0026 = (1 - \\alpha)^n Q_1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha(1 - \\alpha)^{n-i}R_i \\\\ \\end{align}$$  Choosing a positive $Q_1(a)$ value helps the model to explore more and thus learn better in the long run. Upper-Confidence-Bound Action Selection Method $\\varepsilon$-greedy action selection method forces the non-greedy actions to be tried, but indiscriminately, with no preference to those that are nearly greedy. It would be better to select among the non-greedy actions according to their potential for actually being optimal, taking into account both how close their estimates are to being maximal and the uncertanities in those estimates.\nOne effective way of doing this is to select action as:\n$A_t = \\underset{a}{\\operatorname{argmax}}\\Bigl[Qt(a) + \\sqrt[\\leftroot{-2}\\uproot{2}c]{\\tfrac{\\log t}{N_t(a)}} \\Bigr]$\nwhere $\\log t$ denotes the natural logarithm of $t$ , $N_t(a)$ denotes the number of times that action $a$ has been selected prior to time $t$ and the number $ c \\gt 0$ controls the degree of exploration. If $N_t(a) = 0$, then $a$ is considered to be a maximizing action.\nThe idea of this method is that the square-root term is a measure of the uncertainity or variance in the measure of $a$'s value.Each time action $a$ is selected $N_t(a)$ increases by one and the contribution of the square-root term in selecting action $A_t$ is decreased.That means that if $a$ is chosen a lot of times then chances of it being selected depends mostly on $Q_t$, which should be the behaviour of our model, logically.\nGradient Bandit Algorithms In this section we consider learning a numerical preference $H_t(a)$ for each action $a$. The larger the preference more often that action is tken, but the preference has no interpretation in terms of reward.Since the relative preference is important we take softmax over all the preferences at time $t$ which we denote as $\\pi_{t}(a)$.\n$Pr{A_t=a} = \\frac{\\varepsilon^{H_t(a)}}{\\sum_{b=1}^{k} \\varepsilon^{H_t(b)}} = \\pi_{t}(a)$\nThere is a natural learning algorithm for this setting based on the idea of stochastic gradient ascent.On each step, after selecting the action $A_t$ and receiving the reward $R_t$, the preferences are updated by:\n $$\\begin{align} H_{t+1}(A_t) \u0026 = H_t(A_t) + \\alpha(R_t - \\bar R_t)(1 - \\pi_{t}(A_t)), \\text{ and } \\\\ H_{t+1}(a) \u0026 = H_t(a) - \\alpha(R_t - \\bar R_t)(\\pi_{t}(a)) \\text{ } \\forall a \\neq A_t \\\\ \\end{align}$$  where $\\alpha \\gt 0$ is step-size parameter, and $\\bar R_t \\in \\mathbb R$ is the average of all the rewards up throught and including time $t$, which can be computed incrementally.The $\\bar R_t$ serves as the baseline with which the reward is compared. If the reward is higher than the baseline, then the probability of taking $A_t$ in the future is increased, and if the reward is below baseline, then the probability is decreased.The non-selected actions move in the opposite direction.\nFor the represenation of the Bandit Gradient Algorithm as Stochastic Gradient Ascent please refer section-2.8(page 29) of the book.\nNote: This a summarization of Chapter 2 of the book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction ","date":1510225580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510225580,"objectID":"01c8d01c43a18c215360d32bae65cec2","permalink":"https://kiranpurohit.github.io/news/rl_chapter2/","publishdate":"2017-11-09T16:36:20+05:30","relpermalink":"/news/rl_chapter2/","section":"news","summary":"Introduction Reinforcement Learning is different from other machine learning in the aspect that it evaluates the actions rather than instructing than instructing the correct actions.\n  Purely evaluative feedback indicates how good an action is , but not whether it is best or worst action possible.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning-An Introduction"],"title":"Multi-Armed Bandits","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Reinforcement Learning-An Introduction"],"content":"Introduction Reinforcement Learning is different from other machine learning in the aspect that it evaluates the actions rather than instructing than instructing the correct actions.\n  Purely evaluative feedback indicates how good an action is , but not whether it is best or worst action possible.\n  Purely instructive feedback indicates the correct action to take independent of the action already taken.\n  K-Armed Bandit Problem The k-armed bandit problem is similar to one-armed bandits, except that it has k levers instead of one.

This is because almost all network protocols follow big endian.\nHow to check endianness of your pc  You can either use the following command  lscpu  and check the endianness of your pc\n You can also use the following cpp code to check the endianness of your pc  # include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { unsigned long i = 1; int *c = (int*)\u0026amp;i; if (c[0]==1) printf(\u0026quot;Little endian\\n\u0026quot;); else if(c[1]==1) printf(\u0026quot;Big endian\\n\u0026quot;); else printf(\u0026quot;Unknown Endianness\\n\u0026quot;); }  ","date":1472376267,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472376267,"objectID":"159e31dcf970479c88bd35203a85afb0","permalink":"https://kiranpurohit.github.io/news/endianness_of_your_pc/","publishdate":"2016-08-28T14:54:27+05:30","relpermalink":"/news/endianness_of_your_pc/","section":"news","summary":"While studying networks I came across two system calls namely\n ntoh(s/l) hton(s/l)  Both of the above are related to byte ordering done in the network layer\nntoh(s/l) It is used by host to convert a packet from network byte order to host byte order.","tags":["networks","c++"],"title":"How to determine the Endianness of your PC","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":["byte ordering in the network layer"],"content":"While studying networks I came across two system calls namely\n ntoh(s/l) hton(s/l)  Both of the above are related to byte ordering done in the network layer\nntoh(s/l) It is used by host to convert a packet from network byte order to host byte order.

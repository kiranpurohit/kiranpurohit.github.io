I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), under the supervision of [Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourangshu/). I am also a member of the  [Complex Networks Research Group](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/). 

**Research** - I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, with specific interests in Scalability, Explainability and Data-centric AI. I have applied these techniques on problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My research involves subset selection for efficient and robust deep learning. I would be happy to talk about recent advancements around LLMs.

**Teaching Assistantship** - Scalable Data Mining, Autumn 2023, 2022 & 2021 [(CS60021)](https://panuragreddy.github.io/SDM_2023/), Software Engineering Lab & Theory, Spring 2024 & 2023 [(CS29202)](https://cs20202sp22.github.io/), Foundations of Algorithm Design and Machine Learning, Spring 2022 [(CS60020)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourangshu/coursefiles/cs60020_22S.html), Programming & Data Structures Theory, Spring 2021 [(CS10003)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/pds/semester/2021s/).

title: "Scalable and Accurate Channel pruning @CNeRG Mini Retreat"
event: CNeRG Mini Retreat 
event_url: 


# summary: ""
abstract: "The deeper and wider architectures of recent convolutional neural networks (CNN) are responsible for superior performance in computer vision tasks. However, they also come with an enormous model size and heavy computational cost. Filter pruning (FP) is one of the methods applied to CNNs for compression and acceleration."
